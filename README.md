# Timesheet-Automatin-Tool

Since we all know that we need to fill our timesheets & it's best practice to fill the same daily.
Hence I made a bot that will fill the timesheet on the cloud portal with one click.
The bot is an integration of following 
1. MS Excel - For taking the input from user
2. VBA - Used for automation within the Excel environment
3. Selenium Basic - Used for Web Automation

I have made a detailed video covering the entire process.
